This is my first post on my new blog! First off,
it's way too hard to make a blog. You would think something so integral
and simple to the internet would be really quick to spin up.
But, there are actually a couple of steps involved. I guess overall, the steps were 
pretty quick. All I did was download a gatsby template and then
host it on GitHub pages. But I don't know, I expected to do it in a much smoother way.
In fact! I should write a blog post about how to make a free blog as a student.
